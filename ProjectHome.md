SBUS is a messaging middleware which supports data streams.

This project ports SBUS to Android using the [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html), using the [Java Native Interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Native_Interface) to provide a Java API to Android apps.

The project extends SBUS to support schema conversion between endpoints which helps application developers cope with uncertainty in endpoints.

The Java API supports _policies_. A policy allows a developer to specify how endpoints should be remapped when specific events occur.

Additionally, some example applications are included.

This project originally started for my part II project in Computer Science.
