\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

The original aim of the project was to create a system which could adapt to the changes in context which come with mobility, such as location or networks. 
This required the ability to detect these changes, in order to find and connect to new data sources. 
As a new data source may have different data schema to the expected schema, the system must offer a way to make meaningful use of this data in relation to the expected schema.

\section*{Work Completed}

A messaging middleware was modified to allow users to search for data sources by aspects of their schema. Users can search for an exact match on some part of a schema, or a looser match which only considers field types, and not names.
This middleware was ported for use on Android. An application was created which could monitor changes in context and then inform other applications of this change, or automatically connect them to new data sources, dependent on their preferences.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

The main difficulty in the project came from porting the messaging middleware to Android. The Android NDK\footnote{http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html} toolkit was used in order to compile C++ for use on Android, however missing libraries and poor documentation made this task more difficult than expected.

\chapter{Introduction}

% summarise
While many applications now exist for mobile devices, few of the applications themselves are truly mobile. 
The user may happen to be mobile, however the application does not adapt to different environments. 
This project addresses the issues faced in creating applications which can change to suit different environments. 
I show how an application can find relevant data sources in an environment, and how it may offer flexibility in the data it uses.

\section{Problem}
% what's the problem
Different environments mean that devices operate in different contexts and scopes, which dictate how a device can interact with the environment. 
In some of these environments, there may be Wi-Fi networks available, in which it would be sufficient to use a data source from that network. 
However, this data source may have its scope limited to the network, so it becomes unavailable when leaving the network.
In other environments, proximity may be important, for example, when exchanging data via Bluetooth. 
Location may also be an important factor, to ensure that localised and relevant data is used.

Direct communication with local data sources may offer more useful data than an application might have available otherwise. 
However, changes in context and scope mean that data sources an application is connected to may become out of scope, or stop providing useful data. 
In this situation, an alternative data source must be found.

Once this alternative data source has been found, the application must still have some way of knowing whether it provides useful data. 
While some data may be absolutely necessary for operation of the application, other parts may be desired, but operation can continue without them. 
However, even if a data source is deemed useful, the application may still have the difficulty of the data being presented in a different format. 
Some fields may be missing, while others may have different names. 
This means that an application must somehow cope with unknown data formats.

\section{Project}
% what I've done
This project creates a context-aware system which can adapt according to changes in the environment.\cite{Schilit:1994:CCA:1439278.1440041} 
In adapting to the new environment, the system automatically reconfigures applications' connections to allow use of them to continue with as little interruption as possible. 
This reconfiguration has two parts to it: finding data sources, and handling different data formats.

The system allows applications on the device to register to have their connections reconfigured when appropriate. 
Registrations can either be to automatically reconfigure the connection for the application, or to simply notify the application of a change, allowing it to perform a callback method.
As part of this registration, constraints may be specified about how the application wants the connection to be reconfigured. 
These may be simple constraints, such as the name of a data source, or more complex constraints regarding the structure of the data which the source uses. 
Once the system detects a change in the environment, it notifies applications of the change or connects them to different sources, as specified in their registrations.

Depending on the constraints, an application may be connected to a data source which does not offer the exact data schema the application expects. 
The system handles this by repackaging messages to map the application's schema. Any extraneous fields are removed, while any absent fields are filled in with ``empty'' values. The constraints are used to infer relationships between fields, even if they have different names. 
Once the system has repackaged the message, it passes it to the application, allowing the application to continue as if it had received a message conforming to its schema.
