\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

The original aim of the project was to create a system which could adapt to the changes in context which come with mobility, such as location or networks. 
This required the ability to detect these changes, in order to find and connect to new data sources. 
As a new data source may have different data schema to the expected schema, the system must offer a way to make meaningful use of this data in relation to the expected schema.

\section*{Work Completed}

A messaging middleware was modified to allow users to search for data sources by aspects of their schema. Users can search for an exact match on some part of a schema, or a looser match which only considers field types, and not names.
This middleware was ported for use on Android. An application was created which could monitor changes in context and then inform other applications of this change, or automatically connect them to new data sources, dependent on their preferences.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

The main difficulty in the project came from porting the messaging middleware to Android. The Android NDK\footnote{http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html} toolkit was used in order to compile C++ for use on Android, however missing libraries and poor documentation made this task more difficult than expected.

\chapter{Introduction}

% summarise
While many applications now exist for mobile devices, few applications themselves are truly mobile. 
The user may happen to be mobile, however the application does not adapt to different environments. 
This project addresses the issues faced in creating applications which can change to suit different environments. 
I show how an application can find relevant data sources in an environment, and how it may offer flexibility in the data it uses.

\section{Problem}
% what's the problem
Different environments mean that devices operate in different contexts and scopes, which dictate how a device can interact with the environment. 
Context may consist of both physical attributes, such as available Wi-Fi networks and location, as well as psychological aspects such as the user's behaviour or mood.
For example, the device may deduce from the accelerometer that the user is running, in which case the user may be in a rush and require different data than if they were sat calmly.
Scope is also an important factor, since data sources may only be available on a particular network, or within a given time period. 
Changes in context and scope mean that an application may no longer be able to communicate with a given data source, or the data it is providing may no longer be useful. 
In this situation, an alternative data source must be found.

Once this alternate data source has been found, the application must still determine whether it provides useful data. 
Some data may be absolutely necessary for operation of the application, while other parts may be desired, but operation can continue without them. 
However, even if a data source is deemed useful, the application may still have the difficulty of the data being presented in an alternate format to the expected format. 
Some fields may be missing, there may be additional fields, and some fields may have different names. 
The application may wish to specify some subscription filter about the messages it should receive, yet without knowledge of the data format, it cannot specify constraints on different fields.

% example
For example, a transport application may face differences in data available about London Midland trains (Figure \ref{fig:londonmidlandtrain}) and Virgin Trains (Figure \ref{fig:virgintrain}). 
Both offer the same data to a large extent, including as stations, arrival times, and platform numbers, however Virgin Trains might also provide a menu for an on-board shop. 
Alternatively, the application may be used in a French railway station. 
Data about the trains will still be very similar, however the field names may be in French (Figure \ref{fig:frenchtrain}). 
While these differences may be important when the user is sat waiting for a train, they become less important when the user is running to catch a train, and simply needs the departure time and platform number.
Given the amount of uncertainty about what data will be available, a developer creating this application cannot hope to account for all possibilities. 
However, the developer can specify how the application should behave in different contexts.

\section{Project}

% what I've done
Schilit et al \cite{Schilit:1994:CCA:1439278.1440041}  define a context-aware system as one which can examine the computing environment and react to changes in the environment. 
This project creates such a system, which performs automatic contextual reconfiguration for applications whenever there is a change in the environment. 
Pascoe \cite{Pascoe:1998:AGC:857199.858020} lists four context-aware capabilites, two of which occur in this reconfiguration. 
Contextual resource discovery is used to discover data sources available within the context, and contextual adaptation allows the application to adapt to these data sources' schemas in order to use the sources.

Applications on the device can use this system in two ways. 
The first option allows the application to register to be notified of any change in context by the system. 
This allows the application to perform a callback method to determine any action which should be taken as a result of the change. 
The application may also register to allow the system to perform reconfiguration when necessary. 
As part of this registration, the application may specify constraints about how its connection should be reconfigured. 
These may be simple constraints, such as the name of a data source, or more complex constraints regarding the structure of the data which the source uses. 
Once the system detects a change in the environment, it notifies applications of the change or connects them to different sources according to their registrations.

Depending on the constraints, an application may be connected to a data source which does not offer the expected data schema. 
The system handles this by repackaging messages to match the application's schema. Any extraneous fields are removed, while any absent fields are filled with ``empty'' values. The constraints are used to infer relationships between fields, even if they have different names. 
Once the system has repackaged the message, it passes it to the application, allowing the application to continue as if it had received a message conforming to its schema.

The system allows an application to specify subscription filters in terms of its own schema. 
As part of the reconfiguration process the system converts this subscription to match the data source's schema, connecting the application with a working subscription in place.

\chapter{Conclusion}

% summarise
The project has created a context-aware system which enables developers to write applications without prior knowledge of the location of data sources, or the format of their data.
An application will only ever be presented with data conforming to its own schema, removing uncertainty about the format of the data. 
Applications may specify constraints about how fields in a data source's schema must match its own, as an exact match, a type-match, or ``don't care''.
This gives the application control over which data sources it can be connected to, but does not require the application to find the data sources itself. 
Furthermore, applications may specify subscription filters in terms of their own schemas, allowing applications to restrict which messages they will be sent, without requiring filters to be specified in terms of peers' schemas. 
The system ensures that subscriptions applied to peers are in the correct format to restrict messages as dictated by applications. 
Upon a change in context, the system will reconfigure connections ensuring that they conform to these schema constraints and apply subscription filters, allowing applications to continue receiving fresh data.

Referring back to the train example from the Introduction, there may be an application using the London Midland train schema (Figure \ref{fig:londonmidlandtrain}) which requires data sources to contain a structure matching the type of the {\tt train} structure. 
At a small train station served only by London Midland trains, all data sources will match this schema exactly, so the application can connect to any one of them.
Upon arriving at a larger train station and connecting to a Wi-Fi network, the system detects a change in context, and consequently connects the application to a new data source. 
The user may be changing to a Virgin train here, however information about these trains uses a different schema (Figure \ref{fig:virgintrain}). 
This schema does not match the application schema exactly, however it does contain the necessary {\tt train} structure. 
Therefore, the system can connect the application to this data source and repackage messages to match the application schema, allowing the same application code to handle the message. 
The user could have subscribed to only receive data about trains which depart after midday. 
Since this subscription is specified in terms of the London Midland train schema, it cannot be used for the Virgin train schema. 
In this case, the system reformats the subscription to match the Virgin train schema and applies it when connecting the application to the data source, ensuring the user's subscription filter is met.

\section{Issues}
% remaining problems
The system currently faces issues when context is rapidly changing, for example, moving in and out of range of a Wi-Fi network. 
The network connection drops causing the system to reconfigure connections, which may disconnect applications from their peers.
However, the network connection is almost immediately re-established causing the system to reconfigure connections again, possibly connecting applications to these same peers. 
If this reconnection occurs before disconnection has completed, the application believes itself to still be connected to the peer, thus will not create a new connection.

A solution to this problem might be to implement constraints which must be satisfied before reconfiguration occurs. 
In a Wi-Fi network, there may be a constraint that the network signal must be greater than a given threshold, meaning no reconfiguration would occur until the user moves firmly into the network. 
If a context change depended on the accelerometer, it might be that the accelerometer must detect some pattern for several seconds before reconfiguration.

\section{Changes}
% what I'd have done differently


\section{Future Work}
% other stuff that could be done

The system currently depends solely on a change in network status to detect a change in context. 
The Android platform offers a whole host of different events\footnote{http://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent.html} and sensors\footnote{http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/sensors/sensors\_overview.html} which could be used to determine a change in context, such as the battery level being low, the timezone changing, or accelerometer readings. 
The system could be extended to use more of these features to determine a change in context, allowing applications to specify how they want to react to different types of change in context. 
In addition to applications specifying the types of change in context they are interested in, the user may have the ability to specify which types of context change are allowed to be used. 
This offers some privacy to the user by allowing them to block applications from knowing if some part of their context has changed.

The constraints on the schema of the data sources which the application can be connected to are currently specified in terms of the field names of the application schema. 
While this works provided there are no repeated fields names within a schema, it would fail on a schema such as Figure \ref{fig:repeatednameschema}. 
A solution to this would be to qualify all names specified in the constraints in a similar way to subscriptions. 
We could specify a constraint for {\tt sensor}, meaning the entire structure, or {\tt sensor/sensor}, meaning the text field.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}
@sensor
{
	txt sensor
	int value
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption[Schema with repeated name]{A schema with a structure named {\tt sensor} and a text field also named {\tt sensor}. A constraint specified on {\tt sensor} would be ambiguous without fully qualified names.}
\label{fig:repeatednameschema}
