\section*{Original Aims of the Project}

The original aim of the project was to create a system which could adapt to the changes in context which come with mobility, such as location or networks. 
This required the ability to detect these changes, in order to find and connect to new data sources. 
As a new data source may have different data schema to the expected schema, the system must offer a way to make meaningful use of this data in relation to the expected schema.

\section*{Work Completed}

A messaging middleware was modified to allow users to search for data sources by aspects of their schema. Users can search for an exact match on some part of a schema, or a looser match which only considers field types, and not names.
This middleware was ported for use on Android. An application was created which could monitor changes in context and then inform other applications of this change, or automatically connect them to new data sources, dependent on their preferences.

\section*{Special Difficulties}

The main difficulty in the project came from porting the messaging middleware to Android. The Android NDK\footnote{http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html} toolkit was used in order to compile C++ for use on Android, however missing libraries and poor documentation made this task more difficult than expected.

\chapter{Introduction}

% summarise
While many applications now exist for mobile devices, few applications themselves are truly mobile. 
The user may happen to be mobile, however the application does not adapt to different environments. 
This project addresses the issues faced in creating applications which can change to suit different environments. 
I show how an application can find relevant data sources in an environment, and how it may offer flexibility in the data it uses.

\section{Problem}
% what's the problem
Different environments mean that devices operate in different contexts and scopes, which dictate how a device can interact with the environment. 
Context may consist of both physical attributes, such as available Wi-Fi networks and location, and user behaviour. 
For example, the device may deduce from the accelerometer that the user is running, in which case the user may be in a rush and require different data.
Scope is also an important factor, since data sources may only be available on a particular network, or within a given time period. 
Changes in context and scope mean that an application may no longer be able to communicate with a given data source, or the data it is providing may no longer be useful. 
In this situation, an alternative data source must be found.

Once this alternate data source has been found, the application must still determine whether it provides useful data. 
Some data may be absolutely necessary for operation of the application, while other parts may be desired, but operation can continue without them. 
However, even if a data source is deemed useful, the application may still have the difficulty of the data being presented in an alternate format to the expected format. 
Some fields may be missing, there may be additional fields, and some fields may have different names. 

% example
For example, a transport application may face differences in data available about Virgin Trains and London Midland trains. 
Both will offer the same data to a large extent, such as stations, arrival times, and platform numbers, however Virgin Trains might also include on-board shop opening hours. 
Alternatively, the application may be used in a French railway station. 
Data about the trains will still be very similar, however the field names may be in French. 
While these differences may be important when the user is sat waiting for a train, they become less important when the user is running to catch a train, and simply needs the departure time and platform number.
Given the amount of uncertainty about what data will be available, a developer creating this application cannot hope to account for all possibilities. The developer can however specify how the application should behave in different contexts.

\section{Project}

% what I've done
Schilit et al \cite{Schilit:1994:CCA:1439278.1440041}  define a context-aware system as one which can examine the computing environment and react to changes in the environment. 
This project creates such a system, which performs automatic contextual reconfiguration for applications whenever there is a change in the environment. 
Pascoe \cite{Pascoe:1998:AGC:857199.858020} defines four context-aware capabilites, two of which occur in this reconfiguration. 
Contextual resource discovery is used to discover data sources available within the context, and contextual adaptation allows the application to adapt to these data sources' schemas in order to use the sources.

Applications on the device can register with the system, which then handles any reconfiguration necessary.
When registering, an application can specify whether the system should automatically reconfigure it's connection, or whether it should simply notify the application of a change in context, allowing the application to perform a callback method.
As part of this registration, constraints may be specified about how the application wants the connection to be reconfigured. 
These may be simple constraints, such as the name of a data source, or more complex constraints regarding the structure of the data which the source uses. 
Once the system detects a change in the environment, it notifies applications of the change or connects them to different sources, as specified in their registrations.

Depending on the constraints, an application may be connected to a data source which does not offer the expected data schema. 
The system handles this by repackaging messages to match the application's schema. Any extraneous fields are removed, while any absent fields are filled with ``empty'' values. The constraints are used to infer relationships between fields, even if they have different names. 
Once the system has repackaged the message, it passes it to the application, allowing the application to continue as if it had received a message conforming to its schema.
